# Welcome to Our ECE 4180 Final Project : Bluetooth Controller Blinds

## About the Project
With home automation and IoT at the fore front of mordern home innovation, we decided to make the blinds control in ones room wireless.  

Contrary to the popular approach of making an all-in-one “smart blind” that can be controlled via a smartphone app, we aim to create a simpler and cheaper device that serves the same purpose on any regular set of blinds. 

The motor will be remotely controlled via a bluetooth connection, with all related processing being done using the mbed device. We aim to create new drivers for this device and conclude with a product that stresses ease of use and low cost.
